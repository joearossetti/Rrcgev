Package: Rrcgev
Title: Random Coef. GEV Demand with Aggregate Data
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Joseph", "Rossetti", email = "joe.a.rossetti@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimate random coefficient GEV models of demand (e.g. logit, nested logit)
  using aggregate data based on the BLP (1995) model. This package serves largely as an interface
  to C++ code that actually does the estimation.  The underlying C++ classes that
  represent the demand model are exposed to R as Rcpp External Pointers for testing,
  users should not need to use these functions directly.
