Description: Estimate random coefficient GEV models of demand (e.g. logit, nested logit)
  using aggregate data based on the BLP (1995) model. This package serves largely as an interface
  to C++ code that actually does the estimation.  The C++ code depends heavily on the Stan Math Library,
  which provides a user friendly but efficient set of tools for statistical computation,
  linear algebra, and automatic differentiation in C++.  The underlying C++ classes that
  represent the demand model are exposed to R as Rcpp External Pointers for testing,
  users should not need to use these functions directly.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
